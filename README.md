![image](assets/treebreeze-todo-preview.png) 

## Features
- **Dark/Light Theme** changes depending on the time of day, you can also switch it manually.
- **To-Do List** allows you to add tasks, mark as completed and delete tasks that you add.
- **Search** gives you the ability to search on any sites that you can add yourself, !g for google.

## Other Startpages of mine.
- [CloudySnowflake](https://github.com/Z-8Bit/cloudysnowflake) : The same startpage as this but with an alternate colour scheme.
- [OceanBliss](https://github.com/Z-8Bit/oceanbliss) : A simpler and faster startpage with bigger buttons.
